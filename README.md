# GolfSwingVideoComparison

Was created for golfers but can be used by anyone. It allows golfers to compare their swings with other players, take a video of your swing, and get a video of another golfers swing and you can compare the two. You can draw on the video so you can compare better.

This is a desktop application created with Electron, but can easily be made into a website.
